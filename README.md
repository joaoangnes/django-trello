# College project, which must meet the following requirements:

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a web application

task management system, similar to Trello. A
application will allow users to manage their tasks,
including features such as creating, editing, deleting and assigning
tasks to other users, as well as tracking the status of tasks
(pending, in progress, completed).

## Functionalities

of new users, as well as login and logout for session control.
Each user will have access to their own tasks, which can be
managed individually.

- Task statuses: Tasks will have statuses that indicate progress,
such as “pending”, “in progress” or “completed”. The interface
will allow you to filter tasks according to these statuses, making it easier to
organization.

- A dashboard to keep track of all the group's tasks.
